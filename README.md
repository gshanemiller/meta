# description

**Input**: An array of strings city, and an array of unsigned integers population in 1:1 correspondence such that city[i] has population population[i]. Let T be the sum of entries in population.Â 

**API**: A class accepting city, population as constructor const references equipped with a public method void print()

**Output**: When print() is invoked it shoud print exactly one city indexed by i with probability probability city[i]/T.

**Non-functional Performance**: print will be call millions of times. It should be performant.

**Example**: city={NY,SF,LA}; population={20,10,30} e.g. LA popuation is 30. print() should write 'LA' to stdout 1/2th of the time since 30/T = 30/60 = 1/2.

**Assumption**: The input city, population arrays must descending sorted so highest population city at index 0. This can be worked around by a quicksort O(n log n) on both arrays together.
